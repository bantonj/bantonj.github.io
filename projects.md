## Projects
I have various projects on my github page. I mainly work in Python.

### downloader

downloader is a Python package that makes downloading files from the internet very easy. It supports HTTP and FTP downloading, with resume.

It is not something you would use by itself, but incorporate it into a Python script. I made it because the only simple file download packages I could find were based on cURL. cUrl is really great, but it is built in C, is a pain to compile, and kind of a pain to use. downloader is built purely in Python, and only depends on the Python standard library, so there is no dependency hell to sift through.

You can download and get more information [here](https://github.com/bantonj/downloader).

### podcli

podcli is a command line podcast manager. You can subscribe to podcasts, download them, and sync them to any audio player that can be mounted as a drive. Or you can just listen to them on your computer.

It’s pretty bare boned, but I’ve been using is exclusively for the past five years. Below is a screenshot.
